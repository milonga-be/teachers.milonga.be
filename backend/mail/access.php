Hello dear Tango teachers,
</p>
<p>
It's time to update your regular classes on milonga.be and as always you can do this yourself with the online tool. 
</p>
<p>
Go to : <a href="http://teachers.milonga.be/backend/web/index.php">teachers.milonga.be/backend</a><br>
Login : <?= $user->username ?><br>
Password : <?= $user->clear_password ?><br>
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to add new classes or check the existing one.<br>
You can also add a text to present your school (you can now enter longer texts).
</p>
<p>
A newsletter will soon be sent to our subscribers, listing all the schools before September.<br>
If you have any question, feel free to ask.
</p>
<p>
