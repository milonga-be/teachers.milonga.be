Hello dear Tango teachers,
</p>
<p>
It's time to update your <b>regular classes</b> on milonga.be for January and as always you can do this yourself with the online tool. Here is your personal access to do so :
</p>
<p>
Go to : <a href="http://teachers.milonga.be/backend/web/index.php">teachers.milonga.be/backend</a><br>
Login : <?= $user->username ?><br>
Password : <?= $user->clear_password ?><br>
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to add new classes, new venues, change teachers and the informations about your tango school. You can also now add a short introduction to present your school, give the date of the new session, etc.</p>
<p>
If you have any question, feel free to ask ! 
</p>
