Hello estimated Tango teachers,
</p>
<p>
It's time to update your <b>regular classes</b> on Milonga.be for January and this time you can do it <b>by yourself</b> with this new online tool.<br>
Here is your personal access to do so :
</p>
<p>
Go to : <a href="http://teachers.milonga.be/backend/web/index.php">teachers.milonga.be/backend</a><br><br>
Login : <?= $user->username ?><br>
Password : <?= $user->clear_password ?><br>
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to add new classes, new places, change teachers and the informations about your tango school. The changes are immediate.<br>
If your classes don't change, you don't have to do nothing. Just keep this email for a later opportunity.<br>
If you have any question, feel free to ask ! 
</p>
