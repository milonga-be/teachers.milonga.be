Hello dear Tango teachers,
</p>
<p>
Here is a quick reminder : you can as always update your <b>regular classes</b> on milonga.be with our online tool. Here is your personal access to do it :
</p>
<p>
Go to : <a href="http://teachers.milonga.be/backend/web/index.php">teachers.milonga.be/backend</a><br>
Login : <?= $user->username ?><br>
Password : <?= $user->clear_password ?><br>
</p>
<p>
You can add new classes, new venues, change teachers and the informations about your tango school. You can also add a short introduction to present your school, give the date of the new session, etc.</p>
<p>
If you have any question, feel free to ask ! If nothing changes, you have nothing to do.
</p>
